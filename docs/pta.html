                            <p class="lead jjabout2">
                                For many, skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs (pronounced "sniffs"), are viable options for families
                                who have friends and/or loved ones that need medical attention at a daily basis. However, not very many
                                know what to look for when choosing a SNF for a loved one. Here, I'm going to share what I believe makes
                                for a good Skilled Nursing Facility.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead jjabout2">
                                <ul class="lead jjabout2">
                                    <li>The Smell</li>
                                    <p>Yes, the smell. When you walk into a facility, the first thing you should look for is the smell.
                                        It is a great indicator of a well-kept SNF. While 'shopping' around for a SNF take the time to walk 
                                        halls and pay attention to any foul odors! A well kept SNF will not necessarily smell great, but 
                                        odor-free is a sign that patients are attended to and that the facilities are clean.
                                    </p>
                                    <li>The Caseload</li>
                                    <p>The size of the facility is important to consider when choosing a SNF. A larger facility need to be staffed 
                                        properly so the residents aren't spread too thin. In my experience a capable CNA (certified nursing assistant) 
                                        should be able to attend to a maximum of Five patients at a time. I've found that tending to more than that
                                        becomes overwhelming even to capable CNAs. 
                                    </p>
                                    <li>The Staff</li>
                                    <p>A brief explanation ofr the teams a SNF typically consist of:</p>
                                    <ul class="lead jjabout2">
                                        <li>Administrative</li>
                                        <p>This team coordinates accounts and monetary issues involved during the resident's stay. Any issues with the
                                            facility as a whole can be addressed through this team.
                                        </p>
                                        <li>Nursing</li>
                                        <p>The nursing team addresses most things medical-related with the resident. This team ensures medications are
                                            administered on time and as prescribed. They also are in charge of the CNAs, who are interact with the 
                                            residents at a regular basis. This brings me to the next team...
                                        </p>
                                        <li>CNAs</li>
                                        <p>Technically, they are a part of the nursing team. But CNAs roam all over a typical SNF, and commonly are 
                                            closest to the residents who live there. This group are the ones who interact with the residents during all
                                            sorts of daily activities such as dressing, feeding, and toileting. Be nice to the CNAs!
                                        </p>
                                        <li>Rehabilitation</li>
                                        <p>This is my team. The rehab department is responsible for helping the residents recover their previous 
                                            functional abilities. We help residents improve their balance, strength, coordination, while also increasing
                                            their awareness for safety while completing even the most mundane of activities. Our job is to make sure 
                                            residents do not come back after leaving the SNF by being safer while at home.
                                        </p>
                                    </ul>
                                </ul>
                                <p class="lead jjabout2">
                                    There are other teams that make up a SNF like the dietary, maintenance, and social services teams, which are all 
                                    equally important to consider when deciding on a certain facility. The most important thing to consider is that all
                                    teams are on the same page in regards to your loved one's needs.
