<!--
REQUIREMENTS:
1. Must be built using Bootstrap
2. Must contain 3 pages:
    • Blog (alternatively: bio)
    • Projects (alternatively: resume)
    • Contact (alternatively: about)
3. Must have at least 10 active custom styling rules that modify the template or bootstrap theme

STEPS:
2.1
Gathering media
Gather stock photos OR your own original photography (if you have taken photos good enough) to fulfill
the following:
1. Your profile picture (should be a nice, professional photo of you)
2. At least 1 neutral, striking background photo
3. A nice repeating background (optional)
4. A striking CSS gradient (optional)
HINT: For free stock photos, you might try: pixabay.com/
HINT: For great free backgrounds, check out: www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/
HINT: For gorgeous background gradients, check out: www.webcore-it.com/colorful-background/

2.2
Picking a color scheme
1. Pick 1 or 2 complementary colors codes to use in conjunction with or replacing the colors that came
with the template. Colors in CSS are often specified with “hex codes”, for example: #ae0000 is the
code for a dark red, and #f6ffa0 the code for a light yellow
2. Write down these codes into your README.md file
2.2.1
Design Tips: Color Scheme
• When choosing a color scheme, pick several colors that go well together, and not clash with any
background photos you will be using.
• Not sure where to begin? Look at color scheme sharing sites such as Color Hunt or Colour Lovers.
• Try ColorMind.io to pick out a color scheme from a photograph.

2.3
Pick two fonts
Using Google Fonts, pick two nice looking fonts to be used on your page.
• Pick a font to be used for all header text
• Pick a body text to be used for everything else
2.3.1
Design Tips: Fonts
• Pay attention to serif vs sans-serif. For most things you will want to choose sans-serif, but serif can
add a certain “print-like” quality.
• When it comes to picking fonts, caution is key. While handwritten fonts or funky looking “display”
fonts might be fun, they should rarely be used for a professional site. 1
2.4
Brainstorming your new style
1. Google for other websites as inspiration. For example, here are bunch of links showcasing different
designs:
• speckyboy.com/creative-portfolios-of-50-designers/
• medium.muz.li/50-user-profile-page-design-inspiration-5c45aeeda400
• www.mockplus.com/blog/post/personal-website-design-examples
2.4.1
Design Tips: Site style
• Look for something you like, but also stay grounded. You need to get this done by the deadline! 2
• If you want, you may use the same layout and structure as the solution, but don’t copy code from it

2.5
Getting started
Time to actually get started! You have two options: Either hacking away at a pre-built template, or build
it up from scratch using the Bootstrap grid. There are pros and cons to both:
1. Using a pre-built Bootstrap template could end up looking really, really cool. However, to customize
it to your liking you will have to delete a lot of code, and spend time hacking away at it turning it into
yours.
2. Starting from scratch with the Bootstrap grid will allow you to have more control and create cleaner,
clearer code. But it takes more effort and an eye for design to make something that approaches the
design quality of a template someone else wrote.
2.5.1
Using Bootstrap
Using the Bootstrap 4 skills you learned in class, start from an empty file and use the sketch you drew as
reference to build the structure of your page. You might consider starting from the solution to an in-class
activity as the basis.
2.5.2
Using a pre-built Bootstrap-based template
Using the sketch you drew as a reference, look through the available Bootstrap 4 starter templates for one
that resembles what you want. There are many sources for these (try Googling “Free Bootstrap 4 Template”).
To list a few:
• mdbootstrap.com/freebies/
• mobirise.com/bootstrap-4-theme/
• startbootstrap.com/template-categories/all/
• colorlib.com/wp/free-bootstrap-4-website-templates/
Note that some (such as bootstrapmade.com) cost money to to “license” it: bootstrapmade.com/license/

2.6
Fill in your content
Time to roll up your sleeves and dive in to add in your own info! Start by creating the “About” page.
1. Add in your bio
2. Add in a link to your email
3. Add in navigation that includes your name and profile page
4. Generally customize your page so that it contains at least the same amount of complexity as the
example solution

2.7
Start tweaking your style
1. Change all your header elements to use the font-family that you chose from Google Fonts
2. If the color you chose does not match the template or default Bootstrap 4 color, you’ll have to create
new classes that modify the default style. Check look at the source code to the solution and check out
the CSS for btn-red and nav-red to see how you might do this.

2.8
Duplicate for the extra pages
• Copy this bio page 2 more times to create the projects.html page, and the blog.html page
• Make sure your links direct you two these pages
• It’s okay to have placeholder content for now on these pages if you don’t have time to finish the rest.
HINT: To get started with your blog, consider incorporating text you wrote for your Prework Journal.
Many of these “personal musings” could form the basis of an interesting blog post about your journey into
the world of coding. You could use the summary you wrote describing the Hacker News article. Include the
link to the article, and then the body of the text might be useful as the basis of a blog post.

3
Submission
You have two options for submission. Choose only ONE.
3.1
Submitting via zip file
This is probably the easiest. Create a new .zip (or .tar.gz) archive file containing the full contents of your
homework – including all CSS, images, etc – and upload it to either your private chat channel, or using the
online platform.
3.2
Submitting via GitHub
Since we don’t fully cover git and GitHub until week 2, you may not want to try this.
1. Create a new Git repo. You might want to name it solo since this will be be for your Backend solo
homework going forward.
2. Ensure “Initialize with README.md” is checked
3. Clone it from GitHub onto your computer
4. Copy over files into the newly created directory
5. Commit & push to GitHub
6. Send us the URL as your homework submission

4
Bonus
4.1
Write blog posts
You have a space for a blog now. Consider writing a few articles, maybe about the start of your coding journey
with Kickstart Coding, or getting used to Ubuntu Linux, or about some technology you find interesting. Up
to you!
As you continue to work on your site, starting content now will give your final portfolio a boost in terms of
SEO (Search Engine Optimization, e.g. how “Google-friendly” is your site), and allow you to make a much
nicer personal page in the end.
4.2
Mix-in extras
If you have extra time, see if you can integrate one or more of the following free services to spice things up:
• JotForm for a nice “contact me” form: jotform.com
• Disqus for a comment section on your blog: disqus.com
